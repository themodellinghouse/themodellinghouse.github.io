	    <h2>Sources, fate and effects of microplastics in the marine 
		environment</h2>
	  </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6 project-text">
		<p>
        The Modelling House was invited to participate in a series of conferences 
		to debate on the sources, fate and effects of microplastics in the marine 
		environment. The workshops were organised by the United Nations Environment 
		Program (<a href="http://www.unep.org/" target="_blank">UNEP</a>) and the Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of 
		Marine Environmental Protection (<a href="http://www.gesamp.org/" target="_blank">GESAMP</a>).
		Following an initial assessment, 
		the revised work programme for 2015-2018 has two main objectives: to carry 
		out a comprehensive assessment of the topic with input from a wide range of
		disciplines over a 3-4 year timeline; and to provide input to the 2nd United 
		Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA in May 2016) on topics of particular
		interest to UNEP and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).
		</p>
		<p>
		Particularly, the Modelling House coordinated a team of international scientists 
		to produce the second chapter of this assessment which focuses on the global 
		sources of microplastics in the marine environment. The main outcomes of this assessment were:
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>There are primary and secondary sources of microplastics. The distinction 
			is based on whether the particles were originally manufactured to be that 
			size (primary) or whether they have resulted from the breakdown of larger 
			items (secondary).</li>
			<li>Fragmentation and degradation plays an essential role in the formation 
			of secondary microplastics and is very poorly understood.</li>
			<li>Evidence of microplastics inputs to the environment are reported in 
			every life cycles of a plastic product from producers, converters to sectoral 
			or individual consumers and in waste management.</li>
			<li>Microplastics can enter the marine environment via riverine systems, 
			coastlines, directly at sea on vessels and platforms or by wind-induced 
			transport in the atmosphere.</li>
			<li>Methods of defining microplastics, sampling, and measurement vary 
			considerably among studies, source sectors and geographical regions. If the 
			collection of data could be synthetized across studies, a global assessment 
			of microplastics sources quantifying the issue could be made available.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Following this assessment, the Modelling House participated in a regional analysis 
		of sources and fate of microplastics using an in-house particle dispersal model. 
		The study was led by Australiaâ€™s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research 
		Organisation (<a href="http://www.csiro.au/" target="_blank">CSIRO</a>) and aims at targeting areas of concern for the release and the 
		accumulation of microplastics at sea during the United Nations Environmental 
		Assembly in May 2016.
